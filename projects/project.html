     <h1>A STUDY ON WORK LIFE BALANCE AND COMMITMENT OF
        EMPLOYEES WITH REFERENCE TO EMPLOYEES WORKING IN
        ORGANISED RETAIL SECTOR.</h1>
    <p >The Brahmachari Wadi Trust Institute of Business
        Administration (BWTIBA) places a significant emphasis on the
        practical application of research within our academic journey. A
        project is aimed at bridging the gap between theoretical
        knowledge and real-world scenarios, specifically within the
        retail industry. Our focus is on exploring the complex
        relationship between job performance and job satisfaction
        among bottom-level employees in retail establishments.

        By concentrating on this specific demographic, we seek
        to uncover the underlying factors that influence their
        performance and satisfaction levels. Our goal is to provide
        insights that can contribute to the success of organizations
        operating within the retail sector. We are driven by a desire to
        offer actionable recommendations to retail managers and
        policymakers, with the aim of enhancing employee engagement,
        productivity, and overall performance.</p>
